# Hi, I’m Ryan 👋
Electrical Engineering student at BCIT focused on practical embedded systems, robotics, and software development.

I like projects where constraints matter: timing, reliability, power, signal integrity, and getting the whole system integrated (firmware + interfaces + tooling + documentation).

---

## What I’m focused on right now
- Embedded firmware + RTOS patterns (task design, concurrency, logging, serial tooling)
- Sensors and signal processing (radar-ish sensing, serial protocols, real-world noise)
- Building “demoable” systems: repeatable builds, clear docs, clean interfaces
- Developing reliable robotic systems

---

## Skills (practical)
**Embedded / Firmware**
- C/C++, FreeRTOS-style tasking, interrupts, concurrency, debugging, serial tooling
- Peripheral interfaces: UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, PWM

**Software / Tools**
- Python for automation and utilities (serial parsing, CSV logs, quick tooling)
- MATLAB for modeling/simulation when it saves time
- Git/GitHub workflows, documentation, reproducible builds

**FPGA / Digital Design**
- SystemVerilog basics, hardware/software partitioning, memory-mapped I/O
- SoC integration concepts (FPGA ↔ processor communication)

**Hardware**
- Prototyping, soldering, bring-up/debug with scope/logic analyzer
- Working with real constraints (power, grounding, signal integrity)

## Projects I'm Proud to Share
**C language**
- NFC reader attendance system (RTOS)

**C++**
- SCARA robot simulation
- Coloured ball sorter

**Python**
- Nao robot capstone project

**System Verilog**
- Ultrasonic radar system
